# MISP playbooks - guidelines

The playbook guidelines cover two parts:

Part 1:
- **Best practices** such as
- - **Credential** and key storage
- - -  Keys needed to access MISP and external tools or services;
- **Resource** monitoring;
- **Re-usability** of code
- - Storing playbooks in GitHub or GitLab; 
- - Forking and creating a copy;
- - Version tracking.

Part 2:
- A **short tutorial** on how to interact with Jupyter notebooks
- - User interface of Jupyter notebooks;
- - Differences between storing and sharing an executed notebook (with the output of
the code, for example for **reporting** purposes) and a storing and sharing a notebook that serves as a template for a **playbook** (no output included).

These guidelines are in Markdown format and contain screenshots of the Jupyter notebook interface.
