## Attachments

You can add attachments (such as images) to Jupyter notebooks via Edit, Insert Image. In the Jupyter notebook file they are stored in the cell with the key "attachments". Note that attachments can increase the size of the notebook. If you want to remove the attachments then choose View, Cell Toolbar, Attachments.
